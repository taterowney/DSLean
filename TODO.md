- Mix <== and ==> arrows?
- No-ops on the Lean side create an infinite loop when translating downwards (e.g. infinite parentheses)
- Doing let ... := val when val's type of the metavariable somehow gets rid of the info about the metavariable.
- Custom parser states
- Non-ascii characters ok?
- Wildcards/optional within patterns correspond to lists on the other side?
- Could we skip the entire elaboration step by just looking at the SyntaxNodeKind?
- Backtracking (in parsing too) for type filtration?
- Maybe some theorems about correctness/roundtripability?
- Better logic for `num`s/casting
- Why no antiquot at the beginning of a line?
- Automatically infer precedences from Lean versions of operators
- More readable error messages
- No reserving random keywords (put &)
- Combining hypotheses into goal via ->
